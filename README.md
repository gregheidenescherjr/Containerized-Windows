Containerized-Windows

CURRENTLY NIGHTLY BUILDS AVAILABLE ONLY!!! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

Fedora/Qubes Inspired Project for Windows. I know it will not reach their level but,I am adopting as many ideas as I can to bridge the experience. 

The average person should not have to woory about random attacks on their personal files. This is to help increase best practices for the average user. Advanced users all have their own tweaks.

Unfortunatly, Windows and Linux still need more growing pains.  With this project, everyone may rethink computer practices, or the User Interface.

Basically, if you use this Mod/Setup, you are using the same desktop experience as me. A distro/flavor if you will indulge the idea.  

I am big on privacy as far as storing personal information on my computer.  I created my experience initially with Hyper-V.  It still needs work... 

So I switched over to Windows Sandbox and started creating my enviornments to play around. 

The best part of this project is I can focus on my activity without exposing the rest of the PC, within reason.


I do frequently crash my computer and have to restore it often, but I think we can head into a better OS in general.
