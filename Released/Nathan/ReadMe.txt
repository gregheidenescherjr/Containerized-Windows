Nathan,

Save files, open PTEditor, and open file from within, the others will follow suit.  
From there we can add our own tabs as you learn to read sheet music.


Open the installer file with a program called notepad++, you can see how i learned to code from there...

Again, great to meet you. im using a POS bluetooth wireless phone keyboard lol...
